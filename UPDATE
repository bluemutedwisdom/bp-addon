If You are updating form a version before 0.9.6 please note, there are
two more perl modules required now, JSON::XS and LWP::UserAgent, see section 
"Requirements" in INSTALL


Updating from version 0.9.0 or 0.9.1
------------------------------------

You should install into the new default path (/usr/local/bp-addon) and 
URL (http://yourhost.example.com/bp-addon/...)
Please note that You have different URLs and a new local path to 
Business Process AddOns' files afterwards.

Do the following steps:

Save the files of Your nagios-ext/etc directory.

Change to the directory directly above nagios-ext, by default
/usr/local
	cd /usr/local
Delete nagios-ext
	rm -f nagios-ext
If You did create a separate session directory, e. g.
/var/www/nagios_bp.sessions
You can remove this directory too:
	cd /var/www
	rm -Rf nagios_bp.sessions

If You did create a cronjob, for cleaning up old session information, You
can remove this one now. You probably have some line like
*/10 * * * * /usr/local/nagios-ext/bin/nagios_bp_session_timeout 2>&1 | logger -t nagios_bp_session_timeout
in the crontab of the user Your webserver is running under.
Remove it.

On install of Your previous version, You did add some lines in Your httpd.conf
(one ScriptAlias, one Alias and two directory directives - search for the string
nagios-ext). Remove them. You will get a separate config file in apache's conf.d
directory afterwards, when installing the new version.

Now Your installation is as clean as we need it for the installation of the
new version.
(the only things we left over are Links in Nagios's side.html and some host
and service templates and commands You did define in some Nagios config
file - You will change them later)
 
Now it's time to install this new version as described in INSTALL and README.

When You are at the point to add two links to Nagios' side.html remember to
just change the links there instead of inserting them.

If You come to the section
Business Process representation as Nagios/Icinga services
and You did map Your Business Processes to Nagios service before, please note, 
that You also have to change the service templates and the command You did 
define in some nagios config file:
The command check_bp_status must get two parameters now, see README.

Now You can restore Your configuration.
The file nagios-bp.conf You saved from Your old nagios-ext/etc directory
must be put into bp-addon/etc and named business-processes.conf
No changes should be necessary here.

The file which was named ndo_db_readonly.cfg before is now dataBackend.cfg,
has to be in bp-addon/etc too and has more settings.
The best solution would be to copy dataBackend.cfg-sample to dataBackend.cfg
	cd etc
	cp dataBackend.cfg-sample dataBackend.cfg
Afterwards You take over the values You did define in ndo_db_readonly.cfg
into dataBackend.cfg. 

If You are updating from version 0.9.0 and Your NDO database is running on 
another host than the Business Process AddOns, You might want to completely
reconfigure Your values in the new dataBackend.cfg, because it's more easy now 
to configure a different host and port for the database.

The files *-sample in bp-addon/etc can be removed.

The symlinks You added to Your system's perl INC path pointing to *.pm files
in /usr/local/nagios-ext/sbin/ should be removed. They are not needed any 
longer (Business Process AddOns use local libs now only).
If You are unsure, which directories are in the INC path, type
                perl -e 'print join("\n", @INC) . "\n"'

That's it. Now it should work.
If You have problems, see section Help in README.



Updating from version 0.9.2, 0.9.3, 0.9.4, 0.9.5 or 0.9.6
---------------------------------------------------------

You should install into the new default path (/usr/local/bp-addon) and 
URL (http://yourhost.example.com/bp-addon/...)
Please note that You have different URLs and a new local path to 
Business Process AddOns' files afterwards.

You can install the new version completely parallel to the old version because
it uses a new path (bp-addon). So You do an normal installation first, see 
INSTALL. 
The section about editing side.html: remember to just change the links there 
instead of inserting them.
Also You did already create the read-only user for the database last time 
(if You are using a database as backend).

If You come to the section
Business Process representation as Nagios/Icinga services
and You did map Your Business Processes to Nagios service before, please note, 
that You also have to change the service templates and the command You did 
define in some Nagios config file.

Now You can take over Your configuration.
The file etc/nagios-bp.conf from Your old installation must be put into 
bp-addon/etc and named business-processes.conf
No changes should be necessary here.

The file which was named ndo.cfg before is now dataBackend.cfg,
has to be in bp-addon/etc too and has more settings.
The best solution would be to copy dataBackend.cfg-sample to dataBackend.cfg
	cd etc
	cp dataBackend.cfg-sample dataBackend.cfg
Afterwards You take over the values You did define in ndo.cfg into 
dataBackend.cfg. 

The files *-sample in bp-addon/etc can be removed.

Now the new version (under new URL) should be working.
If You have problems, see section Help in README.

It would be a good idea to clean up the old version afterwards. 
To do this, just delete:
        nagiosbp       (directory recursive with all content) 
                       probably found in /usr/local/
        nagiosbp.conf  (file) in Your apache's conf.d directory 
                       probably /etc/httpd/conf.d, /etc/apache2/conf.d or
                       /etc/apache/conf.d
                       RESTART Your Apache afterwards
        nagiosbp       (file) in Your cron.d directory, probably /etc/cron.d

The new installation should still be working.
